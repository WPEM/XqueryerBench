## How to Contribute

1. Upload your score on the branch. If verified, we will add your score to our benchmark (using the simulated test data).
2. Email us your pre-trained model. We will test it on a private test dataset. If there is a large discrepancy in the results, we may request to review your code and training settings.

**No cheating allowed!**
